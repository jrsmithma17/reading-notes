## About Me 
I am 30 years old and I'm pretty much an introvert. I am a huge MeganTheeStallion fan. She inspires me deeply to better myself and to keep going even when the whole world is against you! I love to watch movies and chill with my family. I work in medical claims and it can be mentally exhausting. Definitely taking these classes to help build my empire and to further my knowledge of tech.

### Proud Dog Dad 
I have four fur babies! Luna and Lola are my girls. Chino and Dino are my boys.
